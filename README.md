# Exploration and Implementation of the MAXQ and Qlearning algorithms for the taxi problem

In this paper we re-define MAXQ and the taxi environment and Implement them in R. We then apply
Qlearning to the same problem. Our conclusion is that MAXQ works as good as Qlearning for this
problem. Our aim is illustrate the advantages of using hierarchical reinforcement learning methods.
