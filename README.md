# Exploration and Implementation of the MAXQ and Qlearning algorithms for the taxi problem
In this paper we re-define MAXQ and the taxi environment and Implement them in R. We then apply Qlearning to the same problem. Our conclusion is that MAXQ works as good as Qlearning for this problem. Our aim is illustrate the advantages of using hierarchical reinforcement learning methods.
