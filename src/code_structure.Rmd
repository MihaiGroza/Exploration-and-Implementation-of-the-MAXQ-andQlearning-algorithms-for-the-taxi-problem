```

# File 2: MAXQ0.R [MAXQ]

That one uses the taxi environment above to apply MAXQ method.
To use it, you also need to create an object
```{r}
source('MAXQ0.R')
obj <- MAXQ0$proto()
```

# File 3: Qlearning.R [Q-learning]

Also applies Qlearning to the taxi environment. A set of methods are defined and no need to create objects just call 
```{r}
source('Qlearning.R')
output <- trainQlearning(0.4,0.999,0.017)
```

# File 4: main.R

This file uses all the files above to train the agent on the taxi environment.
